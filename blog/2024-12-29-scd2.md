In the realm of data management, historical changes are conventionally stored in separate Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 (SCD2) tables. However, extracting point-in-time insights from these dispersed sources requires merging them into a single, unified entity.

This guide offers a succinct walkthrough of the process for performing multitable SCD2 joins, presenting two distinct approaches, Direct Join and Unified Timeline, evaluating their respective advantages and drawbacks through practical examples.

Let’s see how to effectively unify historical data and derive valuable insights

## Intent
In data warehousing, Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 (SCD2) tables are widely used to track historical changes in dimension data. However, joining SCD2 tables correctly requires a specific approach to ensure accurate results. This article provides an understanding of the challenges involved and a step-by-step guide to implement robust joins for SCD2 tables.

## Problem
Why is joining SCD2 tables challenging?
SCD2 tables are designed to maintain historical data by creating new rows with updated attributes and validity periods. This introduces two main challenges:
- Temporal Overlap: The same business key can exist in multiple rows, each representing a different validity period.
- Point-in-Time Accuracy: Joining two SCD2 tables must align rows that were valid at the same point in time to ensure accurate results.
A naive join may result in duplications or mismatched records due to overlapping validity periods.

## Solution
### Method 1: Direct Join with 02 SCD2 tables

1. Perform this join condition that enables merging 2 rows that are in the same validity period

```sql
from scd2_table1 t1
join scd2_table2 t2
  on t1.pk = t2.pk
  and t1.valid_from < t2.valid_to 
  and t1.valid_to > t2.valid_from
```

2. Recalculate `valid_from` & `valid_to`
- `valid_from` should be the latest one of the 2 `valid_from` of the 2 tables
- `valid_to` should be the earliest one of the 2 `valid_to` of the 2 tables

```sql
greatest(t1.valid_from, coalesce(t2.valid_from, '1900-01-01'::timestamp)) as valid_from,
coalesce(lead(greatest(t1.valid_from, coalesce(t2.valid_from, '1900-01-01'::timestamp)))
    over (partition by t1.pk
    order by greatest(t1.valid_from, coalesce(t2.valid_from, '1900-01-01'::timestamp))), 
          '9999-12-31'::timestamp) as valid_to
```

3. Filter out rows with `valid_from = valid_to` after join to avoid duplicated validity intervals

In most of real-life examples, `valid_from` and `valid_to` are usually in lower time granularity like timestamp (with the differences down to seconds), hence there might not be cases where these column value “overlapped” across multiple SCD2 tables and we might skip this step. However, for an overall solution, this should be a part of your joining condition.

4. Combine them all together

```sql
with
    prep1 as (
        select
            t1.pk,
            dim1,
            dim2,
            greatest(t1.valid_from, coalesce(t2.valid_from, '1900-01-01'::timestamp)) as valid_from,
            coalesce(lead(greatest(t1.valid_from, coalesce(t2.valid_from, '1900-01-01'::timestamp)))
                over (partition by t1.pk
                order by greatest(t1.valid_from, coalesce(t2.valid_from, '1900-01-01'::timestamp))), 
                     '9999-12-31'::timestamp) as valid_to
        from scd2_table1 t1
        join scd2_table2 t2
            on t1.pk = t2.pk
            and t1.valid_from < t2.valid_to 
            and t1.valid_to > t2.valid_from
    )

select 
    *
from prep1
where valid_from != valid_to
order by PK, valid_from, valid_to, dim1, dim2
```

### Method 2: Unified timeline
This approach to multitable SCD2 joins first creates a unified timeline based on all the `valid_from` from referenced SCD2s. This timeline will be used as a scaffold for joining back all the SCD2s later on. Unlike Direct Join, the deduplication & `valid_to` recalculation steps are done during timeline unification. This allows us to execute all SCD2 joins in 1 CTE instead.

Note that the process is quite similar when joining 02, 03 or more SCD2s:
- Union PKs, `valid_from` from subsequent SCD2s;
- Deduplicate the unioned table to make the following calculation lighter;
- Recalculate `valid_to` from the unioned data to create the timeline;
- Join subsequent SCD2s back to the timeline using this condition below. Repeat for all SCD2s.

#### Unified timeline – Code Snippets

```sql
with
    unified_timeline as ( -- using union to deal with duplicates values instead of union all
        select pk, valid_from from scd2_table1 union
        select pk, valid_from from scd2_table2 union
        select pk, valid_from from scd2_table3
    ),
    unified_timeline_recalculate_valid_to as (
        select
            pk,
            valid_from,
            coalesce(lead(valid_from) over(partition by pk order by valid_from), '9999-12-31'::timestamp) as valid_to,
            valid_to = '9999-12-31'::timestamp as is_current
        from unified_timeline
    ),
    joined as (
        select
            timeline.pk,
            scd2_table1.dim1,
            scd2_table2.dim2,
            scd2_table3.dim3,
            coalesce(timeline.valid_from, '1900-01-01'::timestamp) as valid_from,
            coalesce(timeline.valid_to, '9999-12-31'::timestamp) as valid_to
        from unified_timeline_recalculate_valid_to as timeline
        left join scd2_table1
            on timeline.pk = scd2_table1.pk 
            and scd2_table1.valid_from <= timeline.valid_from 
            and scd2_table1.valid_to >= timeline.valid_to
        left join scd2_table2
            on timeline.pk = scd2_table2.pk 
            and scd2_table2.valid_from <= timeline.valid_from 
            and scd2_table2.valid_to >= timeline.valid_to
        left join scd2_table3
            on timeline.pk = scd2_table1.pk 
            and scd2_table3.valid_from <= timeline.valid_from 
            and scd2_table3.valid_to >= timeline.valid_to
    
    )
select * from joined
-- where valid_from != valid_to -- As we already have a distinct timeline (using union), this condition is no longer needed
order by PK, valid_from, valid_to, dim1, dim2, dim3;
```

## Pros and Cons of Two Methods for Joining SCD2 Tables

### Direct Joins
| **Pros**                           | **Cons**                              |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Simple to implement and understand.| Can result in incorrect joins if overlapping validity periods exist. |
| Efficient for small datasets.      | Requires careful handling of `valid_to` (e.g., NULL values).          |
| No need for pre-processing.        | May fail to align records accurately in complex scenarios.            |

### Unified Timeline Method
| **Pros**                           | **Cons**                              |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Ensures accurate alignment of records across tables. | More complex to implement and requires additional processing. |
| Handles overlapping validity periods effectively. | May require significant compute resources for large datasets. |
| Suitable for point-in-time analysis and historical consistency. | Slightly slower due to timeline unification steps.           |

By following these steps, you can reliably join SCD2 tables while maintaining historical and point-in-time accuracy. Proper implementation ensures accurate data analysis and minimizes the risk of logical errors in your data pipeline.

## Summary
- **Problem**: Joining SCD2 tables can be challenging due to overlapping validity periods and the need for point-in-time accuracy.
- **Solution**: To address this, filter records using the valid_from and valid_to columns and perform a temporal join based on both business keys and validity periods.
- **Implementation**: The solution is implemented using SQL, with a focus on defining a point-in-time context, filtering valid records, and aligning temporal validity.
- **Comparison of Methods**:
    - Direct Joins: Simple to implement but prone to errors with overlapping periods.
    - Unified Timeline Method: Ensures accuracy but is more complex and resource-intensive.
