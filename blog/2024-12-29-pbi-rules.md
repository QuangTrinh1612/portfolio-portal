# Power BI Data Model Governance

Knowing general best practices for the PBI data model optimization, such as avoiding bi-directional relationships, reducing the column cardinality, avoiding DirectQuery whenever possible, or removing Auto Date/Time hidden tables, still remains the key requirement! But, Tabular Editor may help you quickly and easily identify potential violations of these practices — based on the insight gained, you can then decide if you want to apply the recommended practice(s) or keep your original data modeling logic in place through Best Practice Analyzer (BPA) tools.

*And the best thing is that you can run BPA rules on your .bim file prior to CICD deployment to make sure the deployment is validated.*

For example:
- Do not use floating point data types
- Don’t summarize numeric columns
